We also use cookies, as well as resettable device identifiers, to learn more about our users and their likely interests, and to deliver and tailor marketing or advertising. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.</p><ol><li data-score="0.2613598781976945"><p data-score="0.2613598781976945"><strong>What are cookies? <br /></strong> <br /> Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization. <br /> <br /> Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality; we also use other, similar types of technologies. See below for more information and examples.</p></li><li data-score="0.06775333227991237"><p data-score="0.06775333227991237"><strong>What are resettable device identifiers?</strong> <br /> <br /> Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p></li><li data-score="0.2145887728304291"><p data-score="0.1511444374446771"><strong>Why does Netflix use cookies and resettable device identifiers?</strong></p><ul><li data-score="0.28497434962015017"><p data-score="0.28497434962015017"><strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.</p></li><li data-score="0.19440370808167548"><p data-score="0.19440370808167548"><strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.</p></li><li data-score="0.19392962096501729"><p data-score="0.19392962096501729"><strong>Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</strong> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. These types of ads are called "interest-based advertising." Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.</p></li></ul></li><li data-score="0.16159367570409344"><p data-score="0.16593220574733658"><strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and resettable device identifiers? <br /></strong> <br /> For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, <a href="https://c.betrad.com/netflix/customlink.html?locale=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a> . <br /> <br /> To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests. <br /> <br /> Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:</p><p data-score="0.12363153782571598">At this time, we do not respond to Web browser "do not track" signals.</p></li><li data-score="0.14967128828419887"><p data-score="0.14967128828419887"><strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong> <br /> <br /> Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites). Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies. <br /> <br /> We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service. There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies. For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.</p></li></ol><p data-score="0.01861659124387813">To see the prior version of this document, please go to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/privacyupdates" rel="nofollow">www.netflix.com/privacyupdates</a> .</p><p data-score="0"></p><p data-score="0"></p><p data-score="0"></p><p data-score="0"></p><p data-score="0"></p><p data-score="0"></p></div></div></article></div><button aria-label="close" class="modal-close is-large" onclick="closeHighlights()"></button></div><div class="expand-highlights"><button class="button is-dark is-outlined" onclick="openHighlights()">Show Experimental Highlighted Snapshot</button></div><script data-cfasync="false" src="../../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script src="../../static/core/js/highlights.b1254a85a125.js"></script></section></div><div class="column is-offset-1 is-centered-mobile"><div id="policy-overview"><h3 class="is-size-1 is-marginless has-text-weight-bold has-text-warning"><span class="policy-score">4.8<span class="has-text-grey has-text-weight-normal">/10</span></span></h3><p><a href="../../about/index.html#ratings"><small class="has-text-grey-light">How we calculate ratings →</small></a></p><br /><div class="policy-column-stat top-pad"><div class="heading">Version Added</div><p>Sept. 3, 2019</p></div><div class="policy-column-stat"><div class="heading">Ratings Updated</div><p>Sept. 15, 2019</p></div><div class="policy-column-stat"><div class="heading">Warnings</div><p>0</p></div><div class="policy-column-stat"><div class="heading">Maintained by</div><p>kulchynska</p></div><div class="policy-column-stat"><div class="heading">Original Location</div><a class="button is-dark is-small is-outlined" href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Open in New Tab</a></div><div class="policy-column-stat" id="policy-revisions"><div class="heading">Other Versions</div><div class="dropdown is-hoverable"><div class="dropdown-trigger"><button aria-controls="dropdown-menu4" aria-haspopup="true" class="button is-small is-dark is-outlined"><span>Select Version</span> <span class="icon is-small"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></span></button></div><div class="dropdown-menu" id="dropdown-menu4" role="menu"><div class="dropdown-content"><a class="dropdown-item is-active" href="index.html">Latest</a><hr class="dropdown-divider" /><p class="dropdown-item has-text-grey">PrivacySpy has no other revisions of this privacy policy in its database.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="footer"><div class="content container has-text-centered"><p><strong>PrivacySpy</strong> is an <a href="https://github.com/Politiwatch/privacyspy-core">open-source</a> initiative maintained by <a href="https://igor.fyi">Igor Barakaiev</a>, <a href="https://miles.land">Miles McCain</a>, and the <a href="https://politiwatch.org">Politiwatch</a> team.
