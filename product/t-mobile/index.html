Examples of the types of information we collect include:</p><p>Personal Information</p><p>"Personal Information" means information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity (for example, name; addresses; telephone numbers; email address; Social Security Number; call records; wireless device location). Personal information does not include "de-identified,” "anonymous," or "aggregate" information – which are not associated with a specific person or entity.</p><p>Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)</p><p>Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a subset of Personal Information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.</p><p>For more information see CPNI</p><p>Credit and Financial Information</p><p>We collect information about your credit card or banking information, Social Security Number, and credit history for account opening, management and billing and collection purposes. Financial information we collect is governed by T-Mobile’s Financial Privacy Statement.</p><p>Network and Device Information</p><p>We may collect information about your use of our network (or other carriers’ networks when roaming domestically and internationally) and the device(s) associated with your account, network data related to WiFi usage and device, and performance information, as well as data relating to your use of our website, applications and other products and services.</p><p>Location Data</p><p>We may collect your device's location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).</p><p>Performance and Diagnostic Data</p><p>We may collect performance and diagnostic data about your use of our network, networks you roam on, WiFi services or your device. For example, we may collect information about the performance of the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and other device or network performance issues. We may also collect information about applications on your device, the fact that an application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to launch, and length of time an application has been running.</p><p>Telematics</p><p>If you are a customer of the T-Mobile SyncUp connected car service, we, and our application provider, collect data from the SyncUp device in your car. This data includes driver behavior information such as acceleration and braking, speed, and RPM. The device also reports vehicle location via GPS and can report on common vehicle issues called Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC).</p><p>Video Data</p><p>When you use a T-Mobile video application, for example T-Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we can tailor video selections to you or our customers.</p><p>Back Up and Cloud Services</p><p>Some devices may automatically upload to T-Mobile network servers information you have stored on the device and/or SIM card in order to facilitate specific functions. For instance, some devices may back-up your address book, photo album, or diagnostic data. You may choose to disable such uploads, but this may affect functionality of the device or your services. We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile or third-party network servers. For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, text messages, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.</p><p>Collection of Information About Children</p><p>We do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your account, any information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this Statement. If you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set the marketing preferences for any other lines on your account, including those for any children to whom you provide a device.</p><p>Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our websites from anyone under the age of 13. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><p><small class="has-text-grey"><a href="../../create-suggestion/index.html@policy=59&amp;selection=553.html">Click here</a> to suggest a change or to flag this conclusion as incorrect, or <a href="../../about/index.html">here</a> for more information.</small></p></div></div><br /></div><div class="rubric-selection"><div class="selection-overview" onclick="toggleRubricSelection('#selection-555')"><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class="column is-narrow"><h4 class="is-size-5"><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down" id="selection-555-icon"></i></span></h4></div><div class="column is-narrow"><h4 class="is-size-5"><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-circle has-text-warning"></i></span></h4></div><div class="column"><h4 class="is-size-5 is-upped-slight"><div class="answer"><span>Does the service allow the user to control whether personal data is used or collected for non-critical purposes?</span> <span class="has-text-grey-light">On an opt-out basis, for all non-critical data/uses</span></div></h4></div><div class="column is-narrow is-upped-slight"><h4 class="is-size-4">3<span class="rating-total has-text-grey-light">/5</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="selection-expanded" id="selection-555"><div class="box is-margined"><p class="has-margin-bottom"><small class="has-text-grey">Decided Sept. 14, 2019 (<a href="../../revisions/selection/555/index.html">revision history</a>).

We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated third-parties as follows:</p><h3>With Your Consent</h3><p>We may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through "click-through" agreements; when you accept the terms of disclosures on your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores or on the phone, including through interactive voice response, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.</p><h3>To the Primary Account Holder</h3><p>We may disclose information about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide information about you or your use of the service, products or devices to them or others at their direction. When you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party’s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.</p><h3>To Our Service Providers</h3><p>We may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer service, auditing, and marketing).</p><h3>Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers</h3><p>If you are roaming on the network of another carrier or WiFi service provider, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that carrier to facilitate that service. Additionally, services and functionality offered through certain devices are sometimes provided in conjunction with entities other than T-Mobile. As a result, Personal Information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers. For instance, BlackBerry® service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and Personal Information from your device is stored on their BlackBerry Enterprise Servers™. Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy statements apply to those services.</p><h3>In a Business Transfer</h3><p>We may sell, disclose, or transfer information about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a business asset in the transaction. We may also share information with banks for purposes of transferring loans in connection with your device financing.</p><h3>For Legal Process &amp; Protection</h3><p>We may disclose Personal Information, and other information about you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:</p><ul><li><p>To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</p></li><li><p>To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in order to obtain payment for our products and services);</p></li><li><p>To protect our rights or interests, property or safety or that of others; In connection with claims, disputes, or litigation – in court or elsewhere;</p></li><li><p>To protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services;</p></li><li><p>When information is reported to the Spam Reporting Service, it may be shared with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices;</p></li><li><p>To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or</p></li><li><p>In an emergency situation.</p></li></ul><h3>Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners</h3><p>If you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored website, this Statement will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor’s statement will apply to their use of the information. If you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner’s locations (including websites of such dealer or retailer), they may request information from you that is passed to us as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner. This Statement will govern our use of such information, and the partner’s privacy statement will govern its use of such information.</p><h3>De-Identified Information</h3><p>We may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes. For more information about our INSIGHTS Program see T-Mobile INSIGHTS</p><h3>Third-Party Applications for Your Devices</h3><p>We are not responsible for the third-party applications (for example, applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your device. When you install third party applications, you may give your consent for the third party to access information stored on the device and on our network to facilitate the application’s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information – see Location Based Services). The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy statement provided by that third party – not by this Statement. For more information, see Device Apps</p><p>....</p><p>Location-Based Services If your device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location. We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency.</p><p>Depending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the location of your device. These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (“LBS”), are generally provided by third-parties in connection with apps or websites. Third-party LBS providers generally use your device operating system’s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our network, to derive device location. We do not share network location data with third-party LBS providers for their LBS. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third-party LBS are provided.</p><p>In some cases, T-Mobile may provide LBS services. Where we do so, we will request your permission before we access precise location data to support the service. If you have previously consented to our app or service accessing precise location data, you may revoke that permission at any time through the device’s operating system location preference controls or the app settings. You may also follow the standard uninstall process to remove the app from your device.</p><p>T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here. For additional details, please review our article on Location Services in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.</p><p>....</p><p>Advertising You may see T-Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., WiFi or wireline connections). In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your prior online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests. These online ads are sometimes called “interest-based” or “targeted” ads.</p><p>Like most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with advertising networks, which collect certain information about our site and app visitors, serve ads on our behalf, and measure their effectiveness. The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies, web beacons, or use similar technologies on their partners’ websites and apps, including T-Mobile’s. This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties – but we don’t allow these advertising networks to collect information on our websites or apps that identifies you personally (such as your name, address, or phone number). Their use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate. You can opt-out of targeted ads provided by most advertising networks. Please be aware, however, that even if you opt-out of interest-based ads, you will continue to see just as many ads, but they may not be as relevant to you.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><p><small class="has-text-grey"><a href="../../create-suggestion/index.html@policy=59&amp;selection=551.html">Click here</a> to suggest a change or to flag this conclusion as incorrect, or <a href="../../about/index.html">here</a> for more information.</small></p></div></div><br /></div><div class="rubric-selection"><div class="selection-overview" onclick="toggleRubricSelection('#selection-545')"><div class="columns is-mobile"><div class="column is-narrow"><h4 class="is-size-5"><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down" id="selection-545-icon"></i></span></h4></div><div class="column is-narrow"><h4 class="is-size-5"><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-circle has-text-danger"></i></span></h4></div><div class="column"><h4 class="is-size-5 is-upped-slight"><div class="answer"><span>Does the policy allow personally-targeted or behavioral marketing?</span> <span class="has-text-grey-light">Yes, but you can opt-out</span></div></h4></div><div class="column is-narrow is-upped-slight"><h4 class="is-size-4">3.5<span class="rating-total has-text-grey-light">/10</span></h4></div></div></div><div class="selection-expanded" id="selection-545"><div class="box is-margined"><p class="has-margin-bottom"><small class="has-text-grey">Decided Sept. 16, 2019 (<a href="../../revisions/selection/545/index.html">revision history</a>).

You may need to separately opt-out from your other devices. If the opt-out mechanism is cookie-based (such as the AdChoices program) and you delete cookies from your browser or reset your device, you may need to perform the opt-out again. To learn more about ad targeting and how to opt-out of interest-based ads, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p><p>You can also partially manage targeted ads on your mobile device through your device operating system’s settings for advertising IDs. Resetting your device advertising ID does not opt-out the device from targeted ads, but it may limit advertisers’ ability to associate past activity with your device. Refer to your specific OS for details.</p><p>Please note these opt-outs may not impact “contextual” advertisements (e.g., a sporting goods advertisement you see on a sports-themed website) or ads we place on our own websites and apps based on your activity within those properties.</p><p>Ads on Social Media We may work with social media websites or platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter) to serve targeted ads to you as part of a customized social media campaign. You can opt-out of receiving customized ads on your social media platforms by changing your ad preferences on those platforms, which we do not control.</p><p>We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device and line (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device and line– including CPNI). The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users on the account. Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted statements and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We will not intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this Statement. However, if you are the primary account holder, you may designate other "authorized users" (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI.
